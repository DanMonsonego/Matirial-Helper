## Introduction

In the wake of the COVID-19 crisis and government restrictions, there is a specific population facing limitations that prevent them from carrying out basic activities such as purchasing groceries and accessing essential services. To address this challenge, the "Matirial Helper" project was created. It serves as a database and coordination platform for this population and volunteers to provide quick and effective assistance.

## Project Details

- **Registration Webpage**: This webpage allows volunteers and assistance seekers to register. The information provided is then stored in a database, categorizing it by residential location, whether you are a volunteer or a requester.

- **Management Dashboard**: The system includes a management dashboard for administrators. Administrators can view detailed information about volunteers and assistance seekers, create activities for volunteers, and connect them with relevant assistance seekers based on location and availability. Administrators can also perform edit and delete actions on volunteers and assistance seekers' profiles.

- **Tips for Users**: There is a feature for administrators to upload tips and guidelines for users of the platform.
